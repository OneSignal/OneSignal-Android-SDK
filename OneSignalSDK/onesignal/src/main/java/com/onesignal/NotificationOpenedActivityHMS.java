// HMS Core creates a notification with an Intent when opened to start this Activity.
//   Intent is defined via OneSignal's backend and is sent to HMS.
// This has to be it's own Activity separate from NotificationOpenedActivity since
//   we do not have full control over the Bundle.

// Designed to be started with these flags:
// Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK
//   - This gives us the hex value of 0x58000000

// This is to meet the following requirements
//   1. Allows the app developer to omit foregrounding the app if they choose
//      - FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK is required to do this
//      - FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP nor FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK on it's own does this.
//      - FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_WHEN_TASK_RESET would also work but this is deprecated.
//   2. This Activity does not become part of the back stack.
//      - FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY does this
//   3. This Activity does not show in the recent Activities list.
//      - FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_HISTORY does this

// Note on using  Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK | Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_MULTIPLE_TASK
//   We always want to create a new task so it doesn't resume some existing task.
//   If it resumes an existing task then it won't be possible to prevent the app from showing.
//   Some developer want to process the click in the background without bring the app to the foreground.
//   The launcher Activity is started in OneSignal.java:startOrResumeApp if the developer does want the app
//     to be opened.
