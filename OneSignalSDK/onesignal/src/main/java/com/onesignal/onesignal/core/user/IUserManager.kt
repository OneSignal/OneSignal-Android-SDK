/**
 * The OneSignal user manager is responsible for managing the current user state.  When
 * an app starts up for the first time, it is defaulted to having a user with an [identity]
 * of [Identity.Anonymous].  Once the application knows the identity of the user using their
 * app they should call [OneSignal.login] providing that identity to OneSignal, at which
 * point all state in here will reflect the state of that known user.
 *
 * The current user is persisted across the application lifecycle, even when the application
 * is restarted.  It is up to the application developer to call [OneSignal.login] when
 * the user of the application switches, or logs out, to ensure the identity tracked by OneSignal
 * remains in sync.
 *
 * When you should call [OneSignal.login]:
 *   1. When the identity of the user changes (i.e. a login or a context switch)
 *   2. When the identity of the user is lost (i.e. a logout)
