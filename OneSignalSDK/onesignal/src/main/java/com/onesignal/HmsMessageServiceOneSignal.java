 * The hms:push library creates an instance of this service based on the
 * intent-filter action "com.huawei.push.action.MESSAGING_EVENT".
 *
 * WARNING: HMS only creates one {@link HmsMessageService} instance.
 * This means this class will not be used by the app in the following cases:
 *    1. Another push provider library / SDK is in the app.
 *       - Due to ordering in the AndroidManifest.xml OneSignal may or may not be the winner.
 *       - App needs to it's own {@link HmsMessageService} and call bridging / forwarding APIs
 *         on each SDK / library for both to work.
 *    2. The app has it's own  {@link HmsMessageService} class.
 * If either of these are true the app must have it's own {@link HmsMessageService} with AndroidManifest.xml
 * entries and call {@link OneSignalHmsEventBridge} for these methods. This is noted in the OneSignal SDK
 * Huawei setup guide.
