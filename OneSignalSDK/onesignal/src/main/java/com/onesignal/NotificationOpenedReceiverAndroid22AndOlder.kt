 * This is the same as NotificationOpenedReceiver expect it doesn't contain
 * android:taskAffinity="" in it's AndroidManifest.xml entry. This is to
 * account for the resume behavior not working on Android API 22 and older.
 *
 * In Android 5.x and older, android:taskAffinity="" starts a new task as
 * expected, however the allowTaskReparenting behavior does not happen which
 * results in the app not resuming, when using reverse Activity trampoline.
 * Oddly enough cold starts of the app were not a problem.
